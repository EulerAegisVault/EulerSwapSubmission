# Aegis Vault: AI-Powered ML-Strategy Vault on Unichain Powered by Euler

**Submission for the EulerSwap Builder Competition**

This project introduces a sophisticated, autonomous asset management system designed to integrate seamlessly with the EulerSwap ecosystem. We have built an AI-powered agent that acts as an on-chain portfolio manager, leveraging machine learning for real-time risk assessment. Our system automates the complex process of liquidity provision and yield farming, creating a "set-and-forget" solution for maximizing returns from EulerSwap's unique architecture.

This submission aligns with the **Advanced Builds** category, specifically addressing "Pooled EulerSwap Instances" and pioneering a novel approach to "Risk Management Tools."

## Project Vision & Goal

The core challenge in DeFi today is complexity. While protocols like EulerSwap offer powerful new ways to generate yield, effectively managing liquidity, hedging impermanent loss, and harvesting rewards requires constant monitoring and deep expertise.

Our goal is to abstract this complexity away from the end-user. We've built an autonomous system that uses AI to make intelligent, data-driven decisions on behalf of its users. The **EulerSwap AI Vault** is designed to be a fully automated fund manager that not only seeks the best returns within EulerSwap but also actively protects capital using a novel ML-based risk framework.

## System Architecture

Our system is built on three distinct but interconnected pillars, creating a powerful synergy between on-chain contracts, off-chain intelligence, and proactive security.

### On-Chain Layer: The Foundation

The on-chain layer is the system's backbone, built with robust, modular, and gas-efficient Solidity contracts.

-   **`Vault.sol`**: This is the user-facing contract, fully compliant with the **ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard**. This ensures interoperability with other DeFi protocols and tooling. Users deposit assets (e.g., USDC, WETH) and receive vault shares representing their portion of the managed assets.
-   **`EulerSwapStrategy.sol`**: This contract contains the specialized logic to interact directly with EulerSwap. It receives funds from the `Vault` and executes the strategy—in this case, providing liquidity to an EulerSwap pool to earn trading fees and lending yield simultaneously.
-   **Factories (`VaultFactory.sol`, `StrategyFactory.sol`)**: To avoid the 24KB contract size limit and ensure the system is scalable, we use a dual-factory model. This separates the deployment logic for vaults and strategies, allowing us to add new, complex strategies in the future without bloating a single factory contract.

### AI Agent Layer: The Brain

The agent is the command and control center, operating autonomously to manage the on-chain contracts.

-   **Technology Stack**: Built in Python using **FastAPI** for a robust API and **LangChain** to structure the AI's decision-making process. It is powered by OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model.
-   **ReAct Framework**: The agent uses the "Reasoning and Acting" (ReAct) framework. It can reason about a goal, choose a tool to execute, observe the outcome, and repeat this loop until the task is complete.
-   **Core Tools**: The agent is equipped with a set of tools that serve as its interface to the blockchain:
    -   `get_system_status`: Fetches a full report of all vault and strategy balances.
    -   `mint_test_tokens`: Mints mock assets for testing and simulation.
    -   `deposit_into_vault`: Executes a deposit transaction into the specified vault.
    -   `deploy_to_euler_strategy`: The key action. It moves capital from the vaults into the EulerSwap strategy to be put to work.
    -   `harvest_euler_strategy`: Triggers the harvesting of accumulated fees from the strategy.

### Machine Learning Layer: The Shield

This is our most innovative component—a proactive security layer that goes beyond simple audits.

-   **Purpose**: To assess the risk of any smart contract *before* deploying capital. This is crucial for a system designed to be extensible with new, third-party strategies in the future.
-   **Model**: We use an **Isolation Forest**, an unsupervised learning algorithm ideal for anomaly detection. This is a powerful choice because it doesn't require pre-labeled data of "hacks" or "scams."
-   **Methodology**: The model is trained on the on-chain transaction patterns of well-established, battle-tested protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound, Uniswap). It learns what "normal", safe contract behavior looks like across dozens of features (transaction frequency, value distribution, gas patterns, user concentration, etc.). When presented with a new strategy contract, it can generate a risk score based on how much its behavior deviates from these safe norms. The AI agent can then use this score to automatically avoid deploying funds to a contract that seems anomalous or potentially malicious.

## How It Works: A Complete Workflow

1.  **Deposit**: A user finds our vault and deposits 10,000 USDC, receiving vault shares in return.
2.  **AI Detection**: The autonomous agent, running 24/7, periodically calls `get_system_status`. It observes that there is now 10,000 USDC sitting idle in the `Vault`.
3.  **ML Risk Assessment**: Before acting, the agent passes the `EulerSwapStrategy` contract address to the ML model. The model analyzes its on-chain footprint and returns a low risk score, giving the agent the green light to proceed.
4.  **AI Decision & Execution**: The agent's LLM determines that the idle capital should be deployed to generate yield. It formulates a plan, selects the `deploy_to_euler_strategy` tool, and constructs the transaction to move the 10,000 USDC.
5.  **On-Chain Action**: The agent sends the signed transaction to the Unichain network. The `Vault` contract receives the call and transfers the 10,000 USDC to the `EulerSwapStrategy`.
6.  **Liquidity Provision**: The `EulerSwapStrategy` contract then interacts with EulerSwap, depositing the USDC into a liquidity pool. The funds are now actively earning trading fees and lending yield.
7.  **Automated Harvesting**: Days later, the agent observes that fees have accrued. It executes the `harvest_euler_strategy` tool. The strategy contract claims the fees and sends them back to the main `Vault`, increasing the total assets and thus the value of every user's vault shares.

## Future Roadmap

We are committed to building this project out far beyond the hackathon and have a clear roadmap to transition it into a production-ready, feature-rich DeFi protocol.

1.  **Production Hardening & Security**: Our highest priority is to conduct comprehensive, professional security audits of all smart contracts to ensure user funds are completely secure before a public launch.

2.  **Multi-Chain Strategy Expansion**: The vault architecture is designed to be chain-agnostic. We plan to expand by integrating new yield strategies from other leading protocols across various EVM-compatible chains, allowing the AI agent to perform true multi-protocol yield optimization.

3.  **No-Loss Lottery Feature**: A primary goal is to leverage this system to create a **no-loss lottery**. In this model, the collective yield generated by the AI-managed strategy would form the prize pool awarded to a single winner. Afterwards, all participants get their initial deposit back in full, creating a risk-free way to participate.

4.  **Enhancing the AI & ML Core**: We will continue to train our ML risk model with more diverse on-chain data. We also plan to enhance the AI agent's decision-making capabilities, enabling it to manage more complex strategies and react to market changes with greater sophistication.

5.  **Team Expansion**: We are actively looking to bring more developers on board to accelerate progress. We already know a couple of talented people who are interested in taking this project further with us, and we are excited to build out the team to realize the full potential of this AI-driven DeFi system.
